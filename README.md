# YouTube-Application

TechStack - HTML | CSS | JavaScript | Youtube API 

This is Youtube application made using above techstack 
Main thing I used youtube api to make this application fetching data from api 
and append on DOM 

Onclick on video its load video and show on next page, Its shows seperate video
another things are DUMMY in this application.

And for good UI used CSS - grid, rows, margin etc.
